# Cursor game

With this "game" you can see, **REALTIME**, all cursors that are on the website. It's an extremely minimal implementation.

That's it. You can't do anything useful yet. The idea is that this can be the starting point of other random games I want to make.

## Usage

Run frontend with `npm run client`.
Run backend with `npm start`.

Go to `http://localhost:8080`, invite some imaginery friends and have fun.
